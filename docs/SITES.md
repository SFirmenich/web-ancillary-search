## Errores

Those sites where you can define a service but not get its results, the error
is supposed to be in the area of visualizations, and it is of the form:

    Refused to display <url> in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.

or similar mistakes. For this it is recommended to evaluate the way to set
the url search to avoid errors with SSL and others.
