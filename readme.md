# Getting started: #
There are two versions of the tool at this project. The original one, implemented with the Firefox SDK, and a new version targetting webextensions. The idea is to migrate the SDK version to webextensions, since from Firefox 57 onwards, WebExtensions will be the only supported extension type.

You can find a readme_*.txt file with instructions about each project at the root folder of each branch.
